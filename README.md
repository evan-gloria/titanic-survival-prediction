# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features.

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preprocess data and engineer features
- Train and evaluate different ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Optimize model performance
- Share findings and business insights

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` - Processed dataset (only small files if needed)
- `notebooks/` - EDA and model development
- `scripts/` - Scripts for data preprocessing and modeling
- `models/` - Trained model files
- `README.md` - Project overview and results

## 📈 Results
(You will fill this later after modeling — e.g., accuracy, ROC-AUC score)
